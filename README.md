# CareerVista
In today's rapidly evolving professional landscape, students and job seekers often find themselves uncertain about their career paths. With a plethora of career options available, the process of selecting a suitable career that aligns with one's skills, interests, and qualifications can be overwhelming. Traditional career counseling methods may lack personalization, scalability, and data-driven insights, making them insufficient for comprehensive career guidance.

The AI-Based Career Guidance System aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence. By analyzing an individual's skills, academic background, interests, and other relevant factors, the system can recommend potential career paths. The project aims to provide a data-driven, personalized career recommendation to students and professionals, enhancing their decision-making process.The system uses a combination of supervised learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines to predict career roles. Additionally, clustering techniques like K-Means are applied for grouping similar career paths, allowing a more nuanced recommendation. This AI-based approach not only improves the accuracy of recommendations but also adapts to diverse datasets, making it applicable to a wide range of users.

The project leverages the following technologies:

**1.	Python and Machine Learning Libraries:**
•	**Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
•	**NumPy**: For numerical operations.
•	**Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization, including histograms, heatmaps, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.
•	**Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, we use: 
RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, and XGBClassifier for classification tasks.
**GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.
**StandardScaler** for feature scaling.
•	**XGBoost**: For training an efficient gradient-boosted tree model, which is known for its high performance.

**2.	Machine Learning Algorithms:**
•	**Decision Trees**: A simple, interpretable classification model that splits the data based on features.
•	**Random Forests**: An ensemble of decision trees that improves classification accuracy by averaging predictions.
•	**XGBoost**: A highly efficient, scalable machine learning library for gradient boosting, known for winning many Kaggle competitions.
•	**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Finds an optimal hyperplane that separates classes while maximizing the margin between them.
•	**K-Means Clustering**: Partitions the dataset into a specified number of clusters (k) based on feature similarity, minimizing within-cluster variance.

**3.	Model Evaluation:**
•	**GridSearchCV**: For hyperparameter optimization.
**Cross-Validation**: For evaluating model performance and avoiding overfitting.
